<p>Hello there - I'm Matt Oswalt, and the best way I can describe myself is to just fess up to it...I'm a geek. Bordering on "nerd", but doing my best. (Yes, <a href="http://keepingitclassless.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/nerd-venn-diagram-9420-1252236207-2.jpg" target="_blank">it's an important distinction.</a>) I realized that a technology-oriented field was my destiny when I wrote my first windows batch script as a kid.</p>

<p>Professionally, my focus is on networking. I enjoy learning about and operating all types of networks, but lately my focus has been on the data center. I have a lot of experience with other data center areas like storage and virtualization, but networking is really my passion, and I really enjoy applying my networking knowledge towards bridging the gap with other technology areas in a practical way. I am usually at my happiest when I can sit in a room with a virtualization guy, and a traditional networking guy, and mediate a technical conversation to get stuff done.</p>

<p>I enjoy talking about and working with new technology. I've spent a few years writing code professionally, as well as building and designing networks, and because of the recent churn in innovation within IT (especially networking), I am a really happy camper. I am able to use both skillsets in tandem to solve technical challenges, and that's what I love to do as an engineer: solve problems.</p>

<p>As a result of all of this, you can expect my blog articles to be quite a mixture of all of these topics. I might write about a vendor's solution one day, then on a homebrew coding project the next.</p>

<p>Blogging is a big passion of mine - I started Keeping It Classless because my writing is a form of my own learning. When I write about something, there's a pretty good chance that the article was one of my first experiences with the topic. The writing is a way for me to force myself to do the research, generate some useful information, and as an added benefit, share it with the community as a form of giving back. It also helps me, because by participating in this community, I get exposed to a bunch of incredibly smart and helpful folks, who leave helpful comments and that helps me to grow as well. I made a post on OVSDB a while back, and Ben Pfaff himself came on to comment about a fact I had wrong. How cool is that?!?</p>

<p>Outside of technology, I am very passionate about beer. I enjoy making (and tasting, of course) a variety of beer types and really enjoy tweaking the nerd knobs when it comes to hops, malt, and yeast. It wouldn't be far fetched to say that I enjoy making beer and talking about it as much or more than I like drinking it.</p>

I am super responsive there, and my tweets are near-100% technical goodness.</p>

Thanks for stopping by!
