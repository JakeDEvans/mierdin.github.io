Yesterday kicked off the 5th iteration of Network Field Day. For those that haven't heard of [Tech Field Day](http://techfieldday.com/), you need to check it out - there's something for everyone, and it's a great event that gets the technical details from vendors on their solutions. The delegates that are invited are what I consider thought leaders in each field. I've had the privileged of blogging, podcasting, and even meeting with them in person over the past few years, and they're just the right kind of folks to help keep these vendors honest.

The week started off at Cisco, and I encourage you to take a look at those videos over on [Foskett's Youtube Channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/stephenfoskett). Today they're talking to Solarwinds and the conversation is still very engaging.
